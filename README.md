# Tarot Card Project


**About**
- This is a simple page I created using a tarot card api.
- users can get a random single card, three card, or five card draw to get a daily reading
- (or as many as you want)

**Goals**
- my main goal was to gain a better understanding of apis and how they work
- also was looking to sharpen my HTML/CSS skills and design an aesthetically pleasing page
- practing responsive web design
- get creative and have fun
